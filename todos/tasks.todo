ATTENTION:
    ☐ `NO WARNING AT COMPILE TIME`
    ☐ `NO PANIC AT RUNTIME`
    ☐ `NO COLLISION BETWEEN VEHICLES`
    ☐ `NO KEY SPAM`
    ☐ `SAFETY DISTANCE`: distance which enables the vehicles to avoid crashing into each other.


Commands:
    ☐ `↑ Up`   : Generate vehicle from `Bottom`.
    ☐ `↓ Down` : Generate vehicle from `Top`.
    ☐ `→ Right`: Generate vehicle from `Left`.
    ☐ `← Left` : Generate vehicle from `Right`.
    ☐ key `R`  : Generate vehicle from a `random` direction.
    ☐ key `Esc`: `End` of simulation.


Vehicles:
    ☐ Generated with safety distance `(no key spam)`
    ☐ `Painted` depending on the direction
    ☐ Cannot change `selected` route
    ☐ Fixed `velocity`
    ☐ Keep safety distance `(no collision)`
    ☐ Stop at `Red` traffic light


TRAFFIC Algorithm:
    ☐ Vehicle movement
        -> Turning left
        -> Turning right
        -> Going straight
        -> Keeping safety distance

    ☐ Traffic rules
        -> Turn `green` on the most populated lane.

    ☐ Intersection
